- **React** - Awesom library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.
- **Redux** - A predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
- **Express.js**- A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that handles server-side rendering and integrates with Next.js.
- **Less** - CSS preprocessor, which adds special features such as variables, nested rules and mixins (sometimes referred to as syntactic sugar) into regular CSS.
- **Axios** - Promise based HTTP client. Integrated with axios-cache-adapter to cache the reponse to improve performance
- **Docker** - A tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers.
- **Jest** - Javascript testing framework , created by developers who created React.
- **Storybook** - An open source tool for developing UI components in isolation for React, Vue, and Angular. It makes building stunning UIs organized and efficient
- **Babel** - The compiler for next generation JavaScript.
- **ESLint** - The pluggable linting utility.
- **Bundler Analyzer** - Visualize the size of webpack output files with an interactive zoomable treemap.

### 1. Documenting

  - All The Components that need to be documented should be added in `visual-components` directory
  - Add `propTypes` and `defaultProps` to display props documentation
  - Description can be added by adding a comment in MarkDown Format on top of component
  - In `visual-components/[component-name]/stories/[story-name].story.jsx` export a `const test` with sample props
      ```
        export const test = {
          prop1: value1
        }
      ```
  - Check the `footer` component in `visual-components/footer`
  
### 2. Making Api Calls

  - Update Api Url in `src/config/env-config.js` Or in `/.env` file.
  - Use Axios Base Instance from `services/utils/Api.js`
  - store JWT is Cookies using `js-cookie` package or use helpers defined in `Api.js`

3. For a mixed frontend-backend project Api routes can be added in `src/server` directory

0. Start storybook

Follow above step

1. Start Selenium of web drivers

```bash
docker run --name storybook-wdio-chrome -d -p 4444:4444 -p 5900:5900 selenium/standalone-chrome-debug
```

if error `Bind for 0.0.0.0:5900 failed: port is already allocated` comes, you can change that port to other number, like 5901 (`docker run --name storybook-wdio-chrome -d -p 4444:4444 -p 5901:5900 selenium/standalone-chrome-debug`)

**Desktop**

```bash
yarn vr-test:chrome src/components/<component-name>/stories/vr-test/index.spec.ts
```

**Smartphone**

```bash
yarn vr-test:chrome:sp src/components/<component-name>/stories/vr-test/index.spec.ts
